> If you type the exercise as it's written in the chapter, Rubocop will complain about the double quoted strings.  In the Readme.md for this directory, explain how you got rid of the offenses.  Did you fix the strings?  Or did you tell Rubocop to ignore those code style violations?  Why did you pick what you did?

I fixed the strings because I didn't want to do anything to mess up Rubocop (and because Jason tols us to fix them).

On lines, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 I changes the double-quotes to single-quotes. I also added a final newline after line 7.
