> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

They are reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences.

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Reading and writing: You need to be able to type code effectively so that you will be able to understand the code you are either writing or reading.

Attention to detail: Without this you may miss a comma or some other small detail, which will cause bugs or other problems in your programs.  

Spotting Differences: This goes along with attention to detail, you need to be able to notice differences so you can spot bugs or other mistakes.

> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

If you copy and paste you are not training your brain, mind, and hands how to read, write, and see code.

> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

To get good at anything you have to practice every day. Each day it will get a little easier and make more sense.
Focus on slowly improving and you will benefit no matter how good you are at it.
Anything worth doing is difficult at first, just keep at it! If you keep practicing every day and persisting even when it's hard, one day it will click and you will understand it.
