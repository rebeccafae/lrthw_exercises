Study Drills Questions:

> 1) I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it's just 4?

4.0 is not necessary here since the answer t the equation is a whole number. 
If it's just 4, then the answer will return a whole number(120) instead of a floating point (120.0). 
So the sentence would read "We can transport 120 people today."

> 6) Try running ruby from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before and use variable names to do your calculations. Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.


    2.2.1 :002 > cars = 100
     => 100
    2.2.1 :003 > drivers = 30
     => 30
    2.2.1 :004 > cars - drivers
     => 70
    2.2.1 :005 > x = 5
     => 5
    2.2.1 :006 > j = 2
     => 2
    2.2.1 :007 > x * j
     => 10
    2.2.1 :008 > x / j
     => 2
    2.2.1 :009 > x = 5.0
     => 5.0
    2.2.1 :010 > x / j
     => 2.5
